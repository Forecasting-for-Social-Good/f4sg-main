We provide cutting-edge trainings on forecasting sponsored by the International Institute of Forecasters.

## Democratising Forecasting

This is an ongoing initiative that provides cutting-edge training in the area of forecasting (using R). We provide both online courses (under development) and in-person workshops in some of the world’s least developed countries and organisations with social missions. The workshop is free of charge.

The project is initiated by Dr. Bahman Rostami-Tabar and sponsored by the International Institute of Forecasters. The project requires coordination and traveling and has been paused due to travel restriction caused by Covid19 pandemic.

## Online courses

We are currently developing an online version of the workshops. We aim to make them accessible ny April 2022. These workshops will be available to everyone for free.
