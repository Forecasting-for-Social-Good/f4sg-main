We read, debate and discuss forecasting related books, join us ...

## What is the Forecasting Book club?

We would like to create an online learning environment dedicated to sharing knowledge in the area of forecasting to be inclusive to the largest number of learners and contributors. I believe nothing can compare to the knowledge you gain through reading books. Therefore, we created this community to read and discuss forecasting related books.

If you are a learner, this is a platform to learn and develop your knowledge and skills in the area of forecasting. If you are a knowledgeable forecaster and would like to contribute to the creation of a positive online learning community, this is a platform to share your knowledge, skills and experiences! Please get in touch if you would like to present in a session.

## What is the format?

We read and discuss a chapter(s) of a book, the session is informal and coordinated by one of the members. This is not a presentation style meeting, we expect everybody to read the agrred chapter(s) in advance of the meeting and we allow enough time to discuss, debate and clarify problems during the meeting.

We have read the following books so far:

1. [Profit From Your Forecasting Software: A Best Practice Guide for Sales Forecasters by Paul Goodwin](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Profit-Your-Forecasting-Software-Forecasters/dp/1119414571)

2. [Forecasting: principles and practice by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos.](https://otexts.com/fpp3/)

## Current Book

We are currently reading [Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/) by MAX KUHN AND JULIA SILGE

## What is the schedule?

We meet every two weeks on Fridays, 12:30 p.m. - 13:30 p.m. (Europe/London). We are flexible, so if we get members from different tome zone, we will adopt and choose a better TZ for everyone.
