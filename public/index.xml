      <description>This is an annual workshop sponsored by the International Institute of Forecasters
Forecasting for Social Good Workshop While there is a growing recognition by agencies, organizations, and governments that data-driven decision making tools, like forecasting models, can offer significant improvements to the societies they are working to improve, there is not a cohesive body of research that offers guidance on how to best implement, understand, use, and evaluate forecasting methods for societal impact in practice.</description>

      <description>What is Forecasting for Social Good? What is the point of forecasting? If asked this question, most academics and practitioners would say ‘to inform better decisions’, or words to that effect. This immediately prompts two further questions: i) what do we mean by better? and ii) better for whom? Most of the organisations in which a more professional and analytical approach to forecasting is employed have economic and financial goals, such as minimising costs or maximising profits.</description>
